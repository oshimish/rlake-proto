Task list based on requirements:

 

    Create a new React project using CRA and Bootstrap as the CSS framework.
    Integrate Azure Maps JavaScript library into the frontend application to display maps and perform location-based operations.
    Design and implement the user interface for appraisers to input and access data from various sources, such as web, Word, and Excel, and upload Excel files.
    Create a backend service using C# and .NET 7.
    Use Azure SQL/Cosmos DB for storing and retrieving appraiser data.
    Use Redis for caching to improve application performance.
    Implement RabbitMQ queues to handle asynchronous communication between microservices.
    Implement a microservice for processing appraiser data from Excel files and writing it to Azure Data Lake.
    Use Azure Data Lake for storing unprocessed raw appraiser data.
    Implement a pipeline in Data Factory to handle data processing and transformation tasks, including fetching data from Azure Data Lake, processing the data, adding geo data, and storing the data in Azure SQL database.
    Configure the backend service to read appraiser data from Azure SQL database.
    Implement user authentication and access control using an external provider such as Auth0. (is needed ?)
    Use best practices for security, scalability, and performance.
    Test the application and microservices to ensure functionality and performance.

 
List of components, services, and endpoints based on the requirements:
Components:

    React application with Bootstrap CSS
    Azure Maps for location-based services
    Azure Files for file storage
    Azure Data Lake for raw data storage
    Azure SQL Database for processed data storage
    Redis for caching
    RabbitMQ for message queuing
    Azure Data Factory for data processing and transformation

Microservices:

    Excel Processing Service
    Data Processing Service

API Endpoints:

    GET /api/appraisers/{id} - Retrieve a specific appraiser by ID.
    GET /api/appraisers - Retrieve a list of all appraisers in the system.
    POST /api/upload - Upload an Excel file containing appraiser data.

Queues:

    RawDataQueue - Used by the Excel Processing Service to write raw appraiser data to Azure Data Lake.
    ProcessedDataQueue - Used by Data Processing Service to write processed appraiser data to Azure SQL Database.

Data Processing:

    RawDataPipeline - This pipeline should read data from the RawDataQueue and write it to Azure Data Lake. The pipeline should have a RabbitMQQueueTrigger activity to read data from the RawDataQueue and a Copy activity to write the data to Azure Data Lake.
    ProcessedDataPipeline - This pipeline should process data from Azure Data Lake, add geo data, and write it to Azure SQL Database. The pipeline should have a Lookup activity to retrieve the location data from Azure Maps and a Data Flow activity to perform the data processing and transformation tasks, such as joining the location data to the appraiser data, aggregating data, and filtering data.

User Forms:

    Appraiser Detail - Display appraiser details, such as name, address, phone number, and email. This form should be read-only.
    Appraiser List - Display a list of all appraisers in the system. This form should be read-only.
    Upload Excel File - Allow users to upload an Excel file containing appraiser data to Azure Files for processing. This form should allow file upload only.

Containers:

    Excel Processing Service - This container should handle the processing of Excel files uploaded by users. It should read the raw data from the uploaded files, transform the data into a structured format, and write the structured data to the RawDataQueue.
    Data Processing Service - This container should handle the processing of appraiser data stored in Azure Data Lake. It should read the raw data from the RawDataQueue, process and transform the data using Azure Data Factory, add geo data using Azure Maps, and write the processed data to Azure SQL Database.
